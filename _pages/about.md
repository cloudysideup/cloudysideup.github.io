This is the blog of a technologist from Minneapolis, by way of New York.  I'm a generalist with a general niche.  That may sound odd but the IT landscape has become so vast that knowledge a mile wide and a foot deep does not cover nearly as many technologies as it used to.

My general niche is DevOps, approaching it from an Ops background.  With over 20 years of experience designing, building and supporting IT infrastructure architecture, the primary challenge I have found in my career so far is aligning IT needs with business needs and demonstrating the value of IT.  There's a sea change that has been going on for a while now to take on that challenge.  That requires change, and change is difficult.  However, with the right mindset, it's possible, likely and continuous with safety in mind.

That change for me started when I was lucky enough for Dad to put a computer in front of me when I was 6.  When I was 12 I was helping him with his taxes on the same computer.  By 14 I was taking PC's apart and putting them back together.  That desire to solve the physical problems of PC's coincided with solving virtual problems within Mac, Windows and Linux-based operating systems.  By the time I moved to Minneapolis in my early 20's, it was time to scale up to complex systems with different sets of use cases.  Consulting was a natural fit. 

In the past, I've tended to hang my professional hat with Microsoft server applications and operating systems along with Cisco or Dell-based hardware.  But times change.  I'm a Microsoft-certified DevOps Engineer.  The lessons I've learned working for Microsoft Gold Partners solving issues and creating solutions for on-premise or datacenters is still being used.  I leverage the Azure DevOps product set to create visibility and cohesion that helps organizations strategically optimize people and process to accelerate and secure the products their customers use.

Ultimately, organizations get the most value from technology and I get to do what I like for a living, create solutions, solve problems and show the value of it.

IT is an amazing time and space.
