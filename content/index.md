This is my digital garden for cloud platform engineering and architecture, and application/service development.

I'm a cloud platform architect with a background in systems engineering and virtualization.  Half of my career has been in-house, the other half in professional services.  Along the way I've broadened my horizons with a wide variety of compute, networking and storage experience on-prem and in public and gov cloud.  Using this knowledge I've deployed and maintained hyperconverged infrastructure for companies of varying sizes and industries.

Outside of building, deploying and solutioning, I'm raising kids, biking, running, and exploring and learning new hobbies.  Learning and moving is living.
