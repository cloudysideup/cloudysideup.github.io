title: Welcome to Cloudy Side Up
---

This is my digital garden for cloud platform engineering and architecture.  Possibly an evolution into application development.

I'm a cloud architect with a background in Microsoft systems engineering and virtualization.  Along the way I've broadened my horizons with Dell compute and networking, Cisco network security and 3Par storage experience.  Using this knowledge I've deployed and maintained hyperconverged infrastructure for companies of varying sizes.

I've been working my way up the stack for several years.  While making physical and virtual hardware work together was helpful, and still is when solving platform problems, clicking gave way to scripting.  And scripting is giving way to development.
